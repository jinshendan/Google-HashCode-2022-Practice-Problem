### Data analysis


Input data a:

	C = 3	
	Number of different ingredients = 6
	Best Score = 2

Input data b:
	
	C = 5 
    Number of different ingredients = 6
    Best Score = 5

Input data c:

	C = 10
	Number of different ingredients = 10
	Best Score = 5

Input data d:

	C = 9368
	Number of different ingredients = 600

Input data e:

	C = 4986
	Number of different ingredients = 10000

Solution:
    Cases a, b, c can be solved by enumerating ingredients since there are at most 10 different ingredients (hence at most 2^11 - 1 different combinations).
